Today, my topic is "Docker leads software test innovation".

As Docker is accepted by more and more people, it is applied more and more widely. I will introduce the effect of Docker on software testing technology from testing type, Devops, test automation, test scenarios, test practice and so on.

There are some pain points in traditional software development progress. For example, sometimes it is difficult for developers to reproduce the defects testers submit, which leads to argument between the two teams.

The pain point makes test technology face some challenges. For example, how to create clean test environment? How to clean up test environment quickly? How to execute test in parallel and ensure that test environment isn't contaminated?

These challenges used to be a bottleneck restricting efficiency enhancement. With the birth of Docker, some difficult challenges can be smoothly solved. We can effectively support test tasks by use tools of Docker ecology. 

For example, Docker can provide clean test environment for function test and integration test. Testers or customers don't have to set up environment according to lengthy configuration document. It is easy to reproduce defects submitted by customers.
